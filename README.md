🌱 After months of learning, practicing, and experimenting in web development, ultimately I combined all the knowledge I had learned into a project.

🐣 I developed this project using React + Tailwind CSS + a bit of Famer motion and Web3Form.

🐦‍🔥 This design, which I have tried to keep simple while maintaining its frequency, is completely responsive.

Happy coding! 💻
